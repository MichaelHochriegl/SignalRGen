# How to contribute to `SignalRGen`

## Did you find a bug or have a new feature request?

1. Please ensure that another issue is not already created that addresses your bug/feature
2. Create a new issue and describe your problem/request as detailed as possible
3. Link to a small reproduction repository (this is step is optional, but highly appreciated)

## Do you want to contribute any code/doc changes?

Great! I love contributions of any kind and will gladly review your changes.
Please use the following steps:

1. Create an issue describing the change you want to do
2. Wait for feedback regarding your change
3. Fork the repository
4. Create a `feature`, `fix` or `doc` branch on your fork
5. Work on your item
6. Push your branch to your fork
7. Create a merge request to this repository
8. Wait for feedback and/or approval of your work

These sound like a lot of steps but again, I'm happy that you want to contribute, so don't be intimidated.
