# What is SignalRGen?

`SignalRGen` is a NuGet library powered by Source Generators, designed to drastically reduce 
the boilerplate code required for SignalR-based real-time communication.

With sensible defaults, integrating the generated code is effortless, while still offering full customization 
over connection settings and client behavior.

Rather than expanding SignalR itself, `SignalRGen` takes your defined SignalR interface and automatically generates
easy-to-use client code. Thanks to its dependency-injection-based approach, 
integrating your specific client into a modern .NET application becomes seamless.
